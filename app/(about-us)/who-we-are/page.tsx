                Since 2017, Wilmington Mental Health has provided easy access to
                quality care in a convenient location in the port city. Over the
                past decade Wilmington has experienced an influx and the need to
                serve the minority and underserved individuals has increased.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, one in four adults in the area experience a mental
                health condition each year but only few seek help. We want to
                offer genuine and compassionate support to those afflicted with
                mental and physical illness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our treatment programs are person-centered specific. Our team
                includes likeminded providers whose personal experiences and
                worldviews align with the company&apos;s philosophy. We use
                evidence-based methods and follow individualized treatment plans
                to offer solutions to our patients, their families, and their
                significant others so that they can achieve life balance once
                again.

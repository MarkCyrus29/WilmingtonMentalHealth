              Minor surgical procedures can be performed safely and quickly with
              few or no complications without the need to apply general
              anaesthesia. We conduct a wide variety of minor surgical
              procedures at our outpatient office.

              Our highly trained providers can treat minor conditions that
              require minimally invasive techniques, such as wound care, abscess
              drainage, laceration repair, skin tag removal, ingrown toenail
              removal, and wart removal. We will assess your needs and begin
              your treatment when appropriate.

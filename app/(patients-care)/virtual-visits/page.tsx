          <h2>What is Telehealth?</h2>
          <p>
            Telehealth, also known as Telemedicine, Teletherapy, or
            Telepsychiatry, allows for you to schedule and meet with our
            providers directly through the Internet here at Wilmington Mental
            Health and Medical Care. These online audio and video visits connect
            us directly through your computer or mobile device (iOS or Android)
            — it&#39;s your choice!
            <br />
            <br />
            Our providers use Meet, a real-time video-communication service
            developed by Google. Meet&#39;s platform comes with automated
            security and HIPAA compliance to personal health information.
            <br />
            <br />
            This guide outlines basic tips, instructions on how to join your
            video appointment, and answers to commonly asked questions at the
            bottom. Please review all sections before your first Telehealth
            appointment and contact us if you have any questions.
